# taxiWebApp
Runs with XAMMP or LAMP stack locally. I used Dreamweaver as the main IDE with their testing server.

Site is not maintained and may encounter js libraries errors, they keep updating these libraries. It gets pretty annoying. If you able to fix it, please let know.

Hopefully the test sites still up until on http://workrack.com.au/webapptheme11/webapptheme11/admin/login.php admin/123 until I run out of time or cash to host it.

There's also an app that accesses the web app API's. Published the app on https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.log.cyclone

Uses various aspect of XAMMP or LAMP stack here, using PHP, HTML/ CSS/ JS with mySQL. No longer being supported or maintained but learned a lot of deal here and a stepping stone to other similar projects and future technologies hopefully.
